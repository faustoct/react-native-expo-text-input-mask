# react-native-expo-text-input-mask
This is expo is "forked" from https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-text-input-mask to solve the issue found on xcode described here https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-text-input-mask/issues/73

It needs to fix some swift semantic issues what I didn't know how to deal with..
